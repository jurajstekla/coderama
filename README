So whole application has threee main pages as you alreay know.. Search, Details and Favorites. All those pages
are wrapped by "Outlet" component from react-router-dom library. Some of the approaches may seems to be "overkill"
like RouterWrapper. Thats because i wasnt building this app from scratch but i used core of one of my projects that
is quite bigger.

All styling is done with help of MUI. For global state handling is used redux toolkit and for another api call i used
react-query. Clients data are stored in localStorage because compared to another client side storages has much more
available space.

Application is deployed trought GitHub Pages.
